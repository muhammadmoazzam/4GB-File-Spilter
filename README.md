# 4GB-PS3-File-Splitter
This program splits file greater than 4gb in size. This program was initially made for PS3 File splitting for .pkg files to transfer to FAT32 USB Drives.

The program splits or slices Files greater than 4GB in size into 4GB file parts to be able to transfer to FAT32 Formatted USB Drives.
Multiman in PS3 can join these split files because these files ends with .6660x where x will be the part number of the files and these types of files are automatically recognized with multiman.
